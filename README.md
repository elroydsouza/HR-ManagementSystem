### Abstract of the project report
The study of human resource management is constantly developing for the purpose of achieving the best-practice system that guarantees superior employee organisation. In recent times, the use of technology has allowed for greater management through aiding businesses automate and simplify tasks, such as record keeping, or scheduling.  
This project works with Bradford Swissport, a leading logistics and cargo handling company, to improve its current employee management method. The problem in the method stems from the lack of technological involvement as paper-based solutions are combined with cluttered software. This project aims to investigate optimal features through researching state-of-the-art technology in industry, for the purpose of developing a bespoke software to support management at Bradford Swissport.
